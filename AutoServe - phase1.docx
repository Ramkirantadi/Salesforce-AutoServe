AutoServe – Salesforce CRM for Car Service Booking & 
Customer Management 
Project Implementation Phases Documentation 
Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis 
Problem Statement 
Car service centers face challenges with manual booking, overlapping service slots, lack of service 
reminders, and poor tracking of customer/vehicle history. This leads to longer waiting times, 
customer dissatisfaction, and missed revenue opportunities. 
Requirement Gathering 
• Customers should be able to book/reschedule/cancel service online or via staff entry. 
• System must validate overlapping service slots. 
• Automated SMS/Email reminders should be sent for service schedules. 
• Technicians should access vehicle service history. 
• Managers should track daily bookings, revenue, and technician workload with dashboards. 
Stakeholder Analysis 
• Customers: Book/reschedule service, get reminders, track vehicle history. 
• Service Advisors: Manage bookings, assign technicians, update service status. 
• Technicians: View assigned jobs, mark completion, update service notes. 
• Admins/Managers: Oversee bookings, technician utilization, and revenue insights. 
Business Process Mapping 
• Current Manual Flow: Customer calls → Advisor notes booking manually → Technician 
unaware → No reminders → Missed slots. 
• Proposed Salesforce Flow: Customer books service → Lead auto-captured → Slot validated 
→ Technician assigned → Reminder sent → Service completed → Dashboard updated. 
Industry Use Case Analysis 
• Pain Points: Overlapping bookings, no reminders, fragmented history. 
• Opportunities: CRM automation improves efficiency, reminders reduce no-shows, 
dashboards improve decision-making. 
AppExchange Exploration 
Reviewed apps like Field Service Lightning and Booking/Reminder apps. Decided to build custom 
objects, flows, Apex, and LWCs with reference from these apps.
